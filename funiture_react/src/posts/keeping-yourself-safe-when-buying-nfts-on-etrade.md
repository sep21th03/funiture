December 03, 2020 - The Nike Air Zoom SuperRep 2 is designed for high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in group classes or solo sessions. This second version comes with two updated features for a better fit: a fully adjustable, burrito-style tongue and a roomier forefoot.

The SuperRep 2 evolves an important facet of modern fitness — training as sport — and the idea that it's deserving of footwear designed to support the performance needs specific to these movements. That’s why the shoe keeps the tech from the original SuperRep, like the forefoot Zoom Air units for pop on jumps, a reinforced rand to brace against lateral bounds and a flexible “burpee break” for everyone’s favorite total-body punisher.

The Nike Air Zoom SuperRep 2 releases December 10 in China, December 26 throughout EMEA and January 4 globally.
